1 Development of the application Second Brain
1.1 Problem description
The goal of this project is to develop an application that supports the creation of a second
brain - a personal knowledge management system that can be used by students, researchers,
1
and other knowledge workers. You can think of this as a sort of personal Wikipedia. As you
learn new things, you create notes about what you have just learned. Crucially, you create links
among these notes, as you establish connections between the knowledge pieces. The rationale is
that, in the future, you can revisit your notes and navigate through them in meaningful ways.
The system to implement is inspired and adapted from Niklas Luhmann’s Zettelkasten, a widely
popular personal knowledge management system.
Zettelkasten means card file, as in aImbpooxrwtaintht:pvaapreirabclaerdssh.ouTlhdebkeenyaemleemd eSnltipoBfotxh!i!s system is
the notion of note. Luhmann created a system for writing, indexing, and storing notes in such a
way that he could easily find notes and discover connections among them even years after they
were originally written. Whenever he read something interesting, learned something potentially
useful, or had an idea, he created a note for it. Using his note-taking system, he became one
of the most prolific social scientists in the 20th century by leveraging the tens of thousands of
notes he wrote to create ground-breaking scientific contributions.
Your goal is to create a prototype of a digital Zettelkasten. A note has a title, which is
used as a unique identifier (a String which may contain spaces), a date of its creation, the date
of its last edition, and, with the exception of reference notes, a content. It also includes
links to related notes, much like those you find in a web page, such as in a Wikipedia entry. In
this system, we will consider two kinds of links - internal and external links. Internal links
are links to other notes. External links are links to external resources that are referred to in
notes, but are not notes themselves (e.g., a URL).
There are three kinds of notes to consider:
• literature notes Iamreponrottaenst:silmiteilraartutroe tnhootsees osunbe cwlaosuslpdewrmriatneeanbtonuotteas!!particular book
quote, maybe directly in the book’s margins next to the highlighted quote. These notes
include the highlighted quote and any comment the user would like to keep about the
quote. This comment is a text that may include links to other notes. Additionally,
literature notes have a list of reference notes that reference them.
• permanent notes capture stand-alone ideas and summarise information you just learned,
or a thought that occurred to you. For all practical matters, this is captured just like the
comment we just discussed for literature notes. It is common to analyse the summaries in
permanent notes and figure out how they fit into your existing knowledge, leading to new
links to other notes (just like we do for the comment in literature notes). Additionally,
permanent notes have a list of reference notes that reference them. Unlike literature
notes, permanent notes keep a history of update dates, rather than just the last update
date.
• reference notes help you group related information so that you can find it at a later stage.
A common example of referencing is the usage of the hashtag (7) on social networking
platforms. You can do the same with the notes system. Whenever you tag a note, that
note becomes referenced in a reference note that represents all notes with that tag.
Table 1 summarises the information held by the different note kinds.
A typical system will have tImhopuosratnadnst:ofUnseottehse, bHuatsheaTcahblneoctelahssa!s! a small number of links to
other notes. Reference notes usually have a small number of referenced notes. These systems
are typically used for several years, so you can expect to have notes introduced on hundreds or
thousands of dates.

2 Commands
In this section, we present all the commands that the system must be able to interpret and
execute. In the following examples, we differentiate text written by the user from the
feedback written by the program in the console. You may assume the user will make no mistakes
when using the program other than those described in this document. In other words, you only
need to take care of the error situations described here, in the same order as they are defined.
Commands are case-insensitive. For example, the exit command may be written using any
combination of upper and lowercase characters, such as EXIT, exit, Exit, exIT, and so on.
In the examples provided in this document, the symbol ê denotes a line change.
The program must write the message Unknown command. Type help to see available commands.
to the console if the user introduces an unknown command. For example, the non
existing command someRandomCommand would have the following effect:
someRandomCommandê
Unknown command. Type help to see available commands.ê
If there are additional tokens in the line (e.g., a parameter for the command you were trying
to write), the program will also try to consume them as commands. So, in the following example,
someRandom Command would be interpreted as two unknown commands: someRandom and
Command, leading to two error messages.
someRandom Commandê
Unknown command. Type help to see available commands.ê
Unknown command. Type help to see available commands.ê
Several commands have arguments. Unless explicitly stated in this document, you may
assume that the user will only write arguments of the correct type. However, some of those
arguments may have an incorrect value. Therefore, we must test each argument precisely in
the order specified in this document. In their description, arguments will be denoted with
this style, for easier identification. Also, assume by default that any String arguments in
the commands are case-sensitive. So, “Java Iterator” and “java iterator” would be two different
note titles.

2.1 exit command
Terminates the execution of the program. This command does not require any arguments.
The following scenario illustrates its usage.
exitê
Bye!ê
This command always succeeds.
2.2 help command
Shows the available commands. This command does not require any arguments. The
following scenario illustrates its usage.
helpê
create - creates a new noteê
read - reads a noteê
update - updates a noteê

trending - lists the most popular tagsê
notes - lists all notes of a given type last edited within a given time intervalê
delete - deletes a noteê
help - shows the available commandsê
exit - terminates the execution of the programê
This command always succeeds. When executed, it shows the available commands.
2.3 create command
Creates a new note in the system. The command receives, as arguments, the kind of
note, its date of creation, the note’s unique id, and the note’s content.
Notes can be created as permanent or as literature notes. You may assume that the
user will always create notes of a valid kind (either permanent or literature). Reference
notes are NOT created with this command (see the tag command for further details). The
content of a note may encode links to other notes. These links are encoded as Strings starting
with [[ and ending with ]]. Permanent and literature notes also store their creation date and
last update date. For the sake of this project consider time does not go back. So, once you
make a note on 2025/05/05, it is impossible to create or update notes on previous dates (e.g.,
on 2024/12/25). All subsequent notes must be on the same or a posterior date.
Let us start with creating permanent notes. When successful, the note (and possibly
any new linked notes) is created and the program outputs the feedback message (Note ăidą
created successfully with links to ăną notes.). The permanent note history is also initialized
with the creation date. In the example, we first create a new note about Robert Baratheon
being the seventeenth ruler of the Seven Kingdoms and the first king of the Baratheon dynasty.
Then, we create a second note on how Robert Baratheon married Cersei Lannister,
4
to strengthen an alliance with House Lannister. Here, we create three links: one to Robert
Baratheon (the note we just created), one to Cersei Lannister, and another to House
Lannister. This has the side effect of creating a permanent note for Cersei Lannister
and another to House Lannister, if those notes do not exist. In any case, the new note
creates links to those three notes. These links are unidirectional, in the sense that if a note
creates a link from Robert Baratheon to Cersei Lannister, the note on Robert Baratheon refers
to the note of Cersei Lannister, and the note of Cersei Lannister is referred to by the note
on Robert Baratheon. So, if you were to list the notes referenced in the comment about Robert
Baratheon you would find Cersei Lannister’s note, but if you were to list the notes referenced
by the comment on Cersei Lannister’s note, you would not necessarily find the note on Robert
Stark (you only find it if the comment on Cersei Lannister’s note happens to refer to the note
on Robert Baratheon, which may, or may not, happen). There is no upper limit to the number
of notes (of any type) one can create in the system. A third note on Robert Baratheon
brothers, Renly and Stannis Baratheon, illustrates that the system counts the number of
unique links to other notes, when a note contains more than one link to the same note (in this
case, the two references to Stannis Baratheon which link to the same note).

The following errors may occur:
1. If the date is invalid, the error message is (Invalid date!).
2. If the date precedes the most recent creation or update date in the system, the error
message is (No time travelling!).
3. If the system already has a note with a given note id, the error message is (ănote idą
already exists!).
The following example illustrates these error messages.

Literature notes require some additional information compared to permanent notes. Just
like permanent notes, they include creation date (and last update date, which is implicitly
set to be the same as the creation date, when the note is created, but will be updated
with the update command), unique id and the note’s content. Both types
of notes allow to create references to other notes. Additionally, Literature notes include the
literature work’s title and author name, its publication date, URL and a direct
quote taken from the original text.

3. If the creation date precedes the most recent creation or update date in the system,
the error message is (No time travelling!).

5. If the document date is later than the most recent creation or update date in the
system, the error message is (No time travelling to the future!).
The following example illustrates some of these error messages (the others are similar to
what we did for permanent notes).

2.4 read command
Prints the contents of a note. The command receives, as argument, the note id. When
successful, the program will output the feedback message (ănote idą: ăcontentsą ănumber
of linksą links. ănumber of tagsą tags.). In the example, we print the notes on Robert
Baratheon and Cersei Lannister quote. For the time being, assume there are no tags
associated with neither of the notes, so tags count is 0 in both cases.

The following error may occur:
1. If the note id is unknown, the error message is (Note ănote idą does not exist!).
The following example illustrates these error messages.

2.5 update command
Updates a note. The command receives as argument the note id, the update date and
the updated content. When successful, the program will update the corresponding note and
output the feedback message (Note ănote idą updated. It now has ănumber of linksą links.). In
the example, we update the permanent note Robert Baratheon with information about the
love of his life and a few links to other notes. In the output, the ănumber of linksą refers to
the number of different links held by the note in the end of the update. On the surface, the
command works the same way, regardless of the update applying to a permanent or a literature
note. However, permanent notes keep a history of the update dates, while literature notes just
store the last update date.

1. If the update date is invalid, the error message is (Invalid date!).
2. If there is no note with the given note id, the error message is (Note ănote idą does

2.6 links command
Lists all the links from a given note. The command receives as argument the note id
and prints a list of the linked note ids, one per line, by order of first occurrence in the link within
the content of the note. If the note contains no links to other notes, the command prints the
message (No linked notes.). In the examples, we start with a note with no links and follow with
a note with a few links.

The following error may occur:
1. If the note does not exist, the error message is (Note ănote idą does not exist!).
The following example illustrates a failed attempt to list the links in Ramsay Bolton’s
good deeds. As it turns out, we have no notes on his good deeds.

2.7 tag command
Adds a new reference to a reference note (the tag). The command receives as arguments
the referenced note unique id and the reference note unique id and
tags the referenced note with the reference note. If successful, the program outputs the message
(ăreferenced note idą tagged with ăreference note idą.). In the example, a few Starks suffer
a massive health setback and end up tagged as 7dead. In Catelyn Stark’s case, her liveliness
status turns into complicated on account of being both 7dead and 7undead. The latter
example also illustrates that not all tags have a 7.

Catelyn Stark tagged with liveliness = itsComplicated.
The following errors may occur:
1. If the note’s note id does not exist in the system, the error message is (Note ănote idą
does not exist!).
2. If the note identified by note id is already tagged with reference node id, then
the error message is (Note ănote idą is already tagged with ăreference node idą!)
The following example illustrates these error messages.

Note Daenerys Targaryen is already tagged with Mother of Dragons!ê
2.8 untag command
Removes the reference to a referenced note from a reference note. The command receives
as arguments the referenced note unique id and the reference note unique
id and untags the referenced note from the reference note. If successful, the program outputs
the message (Note ăreferenced note idą no longer tagged with ăreference note idą.). In the
example, we remove the reference note 7alive from the note Ned Stark.
10
untag Ned Starkê
7aliveê
Note Ned Stark no longer tagged with 7alive.ê
The following errors may occur:
1. If the note’s note id does not exist in the system, the error message is (Note on ănote
idą does not exist!).
2. If the note referenced with note id is not referenced with (reference note id), the
error message is (Note on ănote idą is not tagged with ăreference note idą.).
The following example illustrates these error messages.
untag Ramsay Bolton’s good deedsê
7mythê
Note on Ramsay Bolton’s good deeds does not exist!ê
untag Littlefingerê

Note on Littlefinger is not tagged with trustworthy!ê
2.9 tags command
Lists the tags associated to a given note. The command receives as argument the note
id and lists all the reference notes (tags) associated with it. The tags are listed in alphabetical,
case-sensitive order. If there are reference notes to list, they are listed by order of tagging, one
note ID in each line. Otherwise, the program should print the message (No tags.).

Note Things Jon Snow knows does not exist!ê
2.10 tagged command
Lists the notes tagged by this reference note. The command receives as argument the
reference note id and prints a list of all notes tagged with this reference note. The listed
notes are presented in case-sensitive alphabetical order of referenced notes id.

1. If the reference note’s reference note id does not exist in the system, the error
message is (Tag ăreference note idą is not used!).
The following example illustrates this error message, when we try to list notes referenced by
an unused reference note id.
tagged Dan and Dave improved this part of the storyê
Tag Dan and Dave improved this part of the story is not used!ê
2.11 trending command
Lists the most popular tags. The command receives no arguments. The tags (i.e. the
corresponding reference notes ids) are listed in order of entering the most popular tags list, one
by each line. If there are no reference nodes yet, the output message should be (No tags defined
yet!), but this should be regarded as normal behaviour (as opposed to an error situation).
trendingê
No tags defined yet!ê
... a few chapters later ...
trendingê
7deadê
7don’t get attachedê
The most popular tags in the system are those with the maximum current number of references
from other notes. You need to be able to maintain these values as tags are added and
removed from notes. As an example, consider that the currently most used tags in the system
are 7dead and 7alive, both with 23 references. Now, suppose that the note Daenerys
Targaryen has none of these tags. If we tag Daenerys Targaryen as 7alive, 7alive
becomes the most popular tag, with 24 references. If we also tag her as 7dead, then both
7alive and 7dead will have 24 references. As 7alive reached this level earlier than 7dead,
it shows up first in the output of trending. If we then untag Daenerys Targaryen as
7alive, 7dead becomes the sole most popular reference node.

2.12 notes command
Lists all notes of a given type last edited within a given time interval. This command
receives as arguments the note kind (either permanent or literature), the starting date
and the ending date. The list is sorted by date. Within the same date, the notes are sorted
by order of last update (which in some cases can be the same date as creation, if the note was
never updated) in the system. If there are no notes to list within the time frame defined by the
start and ending dates, the message should be (No notes in this time frame.). This is considered
normal (as opposed to an error situation).

2. If the starting date is invalid, the error message is (Invalid start date!).
3. If the ending date is invalid, the error message is (Invalid end date!).
4. If the ending date precedes the starting date, the error message is (The ending date must

2.13 delete command
Deletes a note. The command receives a note id and deletes the corresponding note. In
the example, the system deletes the note on Robert Baratheon’s brothers. Deleting a
note can be a fairly complex task. You have to go through all notes referencing the deleted note
so you can remove the references to the note you are deleting. This includes references from all
kinds of notes including permanent, literature, and reference notes.
delete Robert Baratheon’s brothersê
Note Robert Baratheon’s brothers deleted.ê
The following error may occur:
1. If the note to delete does not exist, the error message is (Note ănote idą does not exist!).
The following example illustrates a failed attempt to delete Ramsay Bolton’s good
deeds. Spoiler alert: there are none.

3 Developing this project
Your program should take the best advantage of the elements taught in the Object-Oriented
Programming course. You can use all the techniques discussed in the course lectures. In
particular, this project will focus on the Java Collections discussed in class and the usage of the
Java exceptions mechanism, so make sure you leverage these two elements in your solution. You
should Immapkoerttahnist:aUppselicVaetciotnoracslaesxs tfeonr sliisbtlse!! as possible to make adding new kinds of notes
easier. Use Java’s LocalDate class to store dates.
You can start by developing the main user interface of your program, clearly identifying
which commands your application should support, their inputs and outputs, and error conditions
14
(hint: use the exception handling mechanism to cope with user input mistakes as described in
this document). Then, you need to identify the entities required to implement this system.
Carefully specify the interfaces and classes that you will need. You should document their
conception and development using a class diagram, as well as document your code adequately,
with Javadoc. You can and are supposed to use the Java Collections library presented in the
lectures and labs.
It is a good idea to build a skeleton of your Main class, to handle data input and output,
supporting the interaction with your program. In an early stage, your program will not really
do much. Remember the stable version rule: do not try to do everything at the same
time. Build your program incrementally, and test the small increments as you build the new
functionalities in your new system. If necessary, create small testing programs to test your
classes and interfaces.
Have a careful look at the test files, when they become available. You should start with a
bare-bones system with the help and exit commands, which are good enough for checking
whether your command interpreter is working well, to begin with. Then, add permanent notes,
still with no links. List them. All good? Implement the update command for those permanent
notes. If the listings are still ok, move on to literature notes and do the same. After you have
basic permanent and literature notes, create links among these notes. Make sure you can list
them. When you can, develop the link removal feature. Move on to the tags functionalities, then
the listings, and, finally, the note deletion commands. The order in which the commands are
presented in this document provides you with a reasonable sequence for your implementation,
which is also in line with the order of testing suggested by the tests that will be made available
to you.
Step by step, you will incrementally add functionalities to your program and test them. Do
not try to develop all functionalities simultaneously. It is a really bad idea.
Last, but not least, do not underestimate the effort for this project. START
EARLY.
4 Submission to Mooshak
To submit your project to Mooshak, please register your group in the Mooshak contest POO2025-
TP2. The mooshak login for the group must be the concatenation of the numbers of the students
that make up the group, separated by (the first number must be the smallest). For example,
students #5678 and #5677 should have their Mooshak username 5677 5678. Only the
projects submitted for evaluation through logins following the above rule will be
accepted. The name and number of students that make up the group must be inserted in the
header of all submitted files, as follows:
/˚˚
˚ @author STUDENT1NAME (STUDENT1NUMBER) STUDENT1temail
˚ @author STUDENT2NAME (STUDENT2NUMBER) STUDENT2temail

4.1 Command syntax
For each command, the program will only produce one output. The error conditions of each
command have to be checked in the same order as described in this document. If one of those
conditions occurs, you do not need to check for the others, as you only present the feedback
15
message corresponding to the first failing condition. However, the program does need to consume
all the remaining input parameters, even if they are to be discarded.
4.2 Tests
We expect you to create your tests based on this specification. Create tests for the “happy
day scenario” and error situations so that whenever you add support for a new command,
you also create suitable tests. So, build your tests incrementally as you make your project.
This mimics what happens with the Mooshak tests. The Mooshak tests verify incrementally
the implementation of the commands. They will be made publicly available by May 19th,
2025. When the sample test files become available, use them to test what you have already
implemented, fix it if necessary, and start submitting your partial project to Mooshak. Do it
from the start, even if you just implemented the exit and help commands. By then, you will
probably have much more than those to test. Good luck!
